/*
Clean Code
- Delete unused code
- The name of the struct variable in struct methods should be a lowercase letter
- The name of the module should contain the full GitHub path (github.com/rhaqim/savannah)
- Using string concatenation is not conventional, using fmt.Sprintf is better (postgres.go, internal/core/repo.go, periodic.go, internal/api/repo.go)
- Unit tests should be located in the same folder as the functions themselves (filename: FILENAME_test.go)
- The code is not modular, the data layer is intertwined with the code, and therefore unit tests canâ€™t be created for any data-related function, a minimal interface for the data layer is missing
- The gorm implementation is problematic. You should be using a repository to access your persistent layer.
- migration.go should be under database folder
- errChan in startEventListener function is redundant, all it is used for is printing the errors, they can be printed in the processFunc goroutine

Code Flow
- Instead of redis pub sub can you use channels to handle the communications?
- godotenv.Load should be executed in main.go and your config should be a singleton object
- The service should wait for the event listeners to initiate successfully
- Internal server errors should be logged, but should not reach the client
- HTTP response to a GET request should be included in the response body, and not in a header

Data
- Commit_url column is redundant as it can be built by the two other columns
- Missing index for author request
